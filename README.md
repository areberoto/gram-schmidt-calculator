# gram-schmidt-calculator
A program I coded in C++ that calculates the orthonormal vectors of three 3-Dimensional vectors.

## About this program
This program was my final project for my *Linear Algebra* course that I took at the university, when I was in my second semester. I found the code in my old laptop backup and decided to share it with you. I have to say that this code may be inefficient and could have a lot of improvements in order to work better. At that time I was learning the language and I was new with programming, so I did what I could. I uploaded the code just as I left it at the end of my course (almost four years ago), so I don't really remember much about it. Feel free to use it if you want to.

## PS
The code is commented in spanish, sorry about that. Maybe in the future I translate it to english.
